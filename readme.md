# OpenSesame RSVP plugin

## About

This plugin allows you to add a Rapid Servial Visual Presentation element to your experiment.
The plugin can be used, for example, in a concealed information test (CIT). The RSVP plugin
allows for pupil size measurements during a CIT. Previous research has shown that pupil size 
cannot be actively manipulated, while CITs that measure other bodily sensations can be 
manipulated (Chen et al., 2021). 

The project included research into the implementation of pupil size measurements in CIT and
the development of open source tools (preseting stimuli (text/images) on the screen, 
preparation of the stimuli, and analysis of the data) to be used in CIT. The project is 
funded by Police & Science (Politie & Wetenschap).
